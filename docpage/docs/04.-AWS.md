# AWS

DCNiOS can use some AWS as input. In all those cases it is necesary a valid pair of AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Key.

- DCNiOS takes the credentials from the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- If those environment variables do not exist, the credentials are taken from [aws file credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) with the `default` section.
- If DCNiOS does not successfully use the credentials as environment variables or in the credential file.
DCNiOS gets them from configuration files named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
This implementation is made to minimize the times that the credentials are written in the configuration file.

AWS_DEFAULT_REGION is mandatory in any source that uses AWS of the configuration file.

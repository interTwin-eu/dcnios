# S3

S3 is a ProcessGroup that gets input data from an AWS S3 bucket. Creating a ProcessGroup in Nifi and a SQS queue will be the same as [SQS](02.4.-SQS). Indeed, an event notification from the S3 bucket to SQS will be created.
 - An identifier name of the process. It must be unique.
 - The region where the SQS is going to be deployed. AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
 - The bucket name. The queue name is not necessary. DCNiOS creates an SQS with this pattern name `<bucket-name>-events`.

Here is an example of the configuration file. Check the documentation of [AWS credentials](/dcnios/docs/AWS) to define the Access Key and Secret Key.


> :warning: **Event Notification in the S3 section needs to be removed manually**: Be very careful here!

```
S3:
  - name: S3
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: us-east-1
    AWS_S3_BUCKET: <bucket-name>
```
